Why some species thrive in urban environments while others do not is a central question in behavioral ecology. Behavioral innovations have been proposed as a key mechanism facilitating this adaptation. At the individual level, innovativeness varies with cognitive and behavioral traits. However, at the population level, innovation rates can also be influenced by social and ecological factors, including group size and environmental novelty and complexity. The role of these factors is still under‑explored, especially at within‑city scales. To disentangle factors influencing group‑level variation in innovation rates, we presented roosts of wild sulphur‑crested cockatoos (Cacatua galerita) with extractive‑foraging tasks that required innovative problem‑solving. We installed three tasks of different levels of difficulty on trees at fifteen communal roost sites across an urban matrix. We then matched these with direct measures of roost size and connectivity, and with high‑resolution remote‑sensing mapping to estimate variation in urbanization and environmental heterogeneity. We found that both latency until first approach and until solving varied between locations. Approach behavior was significantly influenced by urbanization, with individuals in more urban sites approaching tasks more quickly, suggesting reduced neophobia with urbanization or increased familiarity with human‑derived objects. In contrast, solving performance was explained by task difficulty alone, with no clear effect of environmental or social variables. This suggests that urban living primarily affects motivation or responsiveness to novelty, rather than cognition or motor abilities. Our study underscores how within‑species innovation rates can vary at local scales dependent on variation in the anthropogenic environments.
