The reason why some species thrive in urban environments while others do not is a central question in behavioural ecology. Innovation—the ability to develop novel solutions to environmental challenges—has been proposed as a key mechanism facilitating urban adaptation. At the individual level, innovations depend on a series of cognitive and behavioural traits, including motor diversity, problem solving, and neophilia. However, at the population level, innovation rates can also be influenced by ecological factors, such as the level of urbanisation, environmental complexity, and group size. The role of these factors remains under-explored, especially in wild populations. In particular, there is a lack of studies that integrate fine-scale environmental variation and social structure.

To address this gap, we presented roosts of wild sulphur-crested cockatoos (Cacatua galerita) with food-motivated extractive-foraging tasks that required innovative problem-solving. We installed three tasks of different levels of difficulty on trees at fifteen roost sites across an urban matrix that varied in environmental (urbanisation and environmental heterogeneity) and social (roost size and connectivity) characteristics.

Both the latency to first approach and the latency to solve—proxies for neophilic behaviour and innovativeness, respectively—varied significantly between locations. Approach behaviour was significantly influenced by urbanisation, with individuals in more urban sites approaching tasks more quickly, suggesting reduced neophobia or increased familiarity with human-derived objects. In contrast, solving performance was explained by task difficulty alone, with no clear effect of urbanisation, environmental heterogeneity, or social context. These findings suggest that urban living primarily affects animals’ motivation or responsiveness to novelty rather than their cognitive ability to innovate. Our results underscore the importance of disentangling environmental and social factors to understand how cognition and innovation evolve in response to anthropogenic change.
