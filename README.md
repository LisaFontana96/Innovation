To disentangle geographical, social, and individual characteristics impacting innovativeness, I propose to present the cockatoos with food-motivated problem-solving tasks (Cole, Cram, and Quinn 2011; Prasher et al. 2019), that will require innovation to be solved. The puzzles will be divided into 3 categories of difficulty, with low, medium and advance complexity.
The tasks will be placed on trees in 13 different roosts distributed in the north/ north-west region of Canberra, that differ both in group size (number of individuals at the roost), urbanization levels, distance from the closest un-urbanized area, and environmental complexity. All of these characteristics will be considered as variables in the experiment. The tasks will need to be solved only ones, and from camera footage, I will record latency, number of visits and attempts until solving, behavior at the task, as well as sex, age, and individual identity (if known). I will concurrently take population-level measures, and data on population genetics will be collected as a proxy for movement rate.  I predict that both environmental factors and population size will play a role in determining the likelihood and latency of innovation across sites, with larger roost-groups in complex and more urbanised environments producing more complex innovations and doing so faster.
